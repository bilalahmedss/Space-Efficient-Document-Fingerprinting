Existentialism and the Meaning of Life (Philosophical Topic)
Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the 20th century, focusing on individual
freedom, choice, and the inherent meaninglessness of life. Existentialists argue that life, by its very
nature, does not provide an inherent meaning or purpose. Rather, it is up to each individual to
create their own meaning through their choices, actions, and personal experiences.

Justice is a foundational concept in political philosophy, ethics, and law. Throughout history, various
thinkers have sought to understand and define justice, often linking it to fairness, rights, and the
distribution of benefits and burdens within society.
