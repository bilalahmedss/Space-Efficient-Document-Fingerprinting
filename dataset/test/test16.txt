Essay 1: The Problem of Free Will (Philosophical Topic)
The question of free will has been a subject of philosophical inquiry for centuries. It concerns the extent to which human beings have the ability to make choices independent of external or internal influences. This question touches on numerous aspects of human life, including morality, responsibility, and identity. At its core, the problem of free will seeks to understand whether humans are truly free in their decisions or whether their actions are determined by factors beyond their control. In this essay, I will examine the concept of free will, the various perspectives on its existence, and the implications of these perspectives on human life.
The Deterministic View
One of the oldest and most influential views on the problem of free will is determinism. According to determinism, every event or state of affairs, including human actions, is the result of preceding events according to causal laws. This means that every action we take, every decision we make, is determined by prior causes, whether they be biological, environmental, or social.

Essay 2: Quantum Mechanics and the Uncertainty Principle (Science Topic)
Quantum mechanics is one of the most fascinating and revolutionary areas of modern physics. It provides the framework for understanding the behavior of particles at the microscopic level, such as atoms and subatomic particles. Unlike classical physics, which describes the motion of objects on a large scale, quantum mechanics deals with phenomena that occur at scales where the effects of quantum phenomena are significant. One of the most intriguing and puzzling aspects of quantum mechanics is the Uncertainty Principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of properties of a particle, such as its position and momentum, at the same time.
In this essay, I will discuss the basics of quantum mechanics, the Uncertainty Principle, and its profound implications for our understanding of the physical world.
