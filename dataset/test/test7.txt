Justice is a foundational concept in political philosophy, ethics, and law. Throughout history, various
thinkers have sought to understand and define justice, often linking it to fairness, rights, and the
distribution of benefits and burdens within society. The idea of justice shapes how societies are
organized and how individuals interact with one another. It is a concept that is both universal and
subjective, as it varies depending on cultural, political, and historical contexts.
