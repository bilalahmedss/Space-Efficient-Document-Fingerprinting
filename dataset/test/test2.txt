Essay 2: Quantum Mechanics and the Uncertainty Principle (Science Topic)
Quantum mechanics is one of the most fascinating and revolutionary areas of modern physics. It
provides the framework for understanding the behavior of particles at the microscopic level, such as
atoms and subatomic particles. Unlike classical physics, which describes the motion of objects on a
large scale, quantum mechanics deals with phenomena that occur at scales where the effects of
quantum phenomena are significant. One of the most intriguing and puzzling aspects of quantum
mechanics is the Uncertainty Principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. This principle
states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of properties of a
particle, such as its position and momentum, at the same time.
