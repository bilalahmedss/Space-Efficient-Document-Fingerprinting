The thousand-year stare
We can build structures that last for centuries, but can we connect with our distant descendants? Make a model of the world in your mind. Populate it, starting with the people you know. Build it up and furnish it. Draw in the lines that connect it all together, and the ones that divide it. Then roll it into the future. As you go forward, things disappear. Within a century or so, you and all the people around you have gone. As things go that are certain to go, they leave empty spaces. So do the uncertainties: the things that may not be things in the future, or may take different forms – vehicles, homes, ways of communicating, nations – that from here can be no more than a shimmer on the horizon. As one thing after another disappears, the scene fades to white. If you want a vision, you'll have to project it yourself.
Occasionally, people take steps to counter the emptying by making things that will endure into the distant future. At a Hindu monastery in Hawaii, the Iraivan Temple is being built to last 1,000 years, using special concrete construction techniques.

The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (Philosophical Topic)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming nearly every sector of human life, from healthcare and transportation to entertainment and communication. While AI offers immense potential for improving productivity and solving complex problems, it also raises important ethical questions. As machines become more capable of performing tasks traditionally carried out by humans, concerns regarding fairness, privacy, accountability, and even autonomy have come to the forefront. In this essay, we will explore the ethical challenges associated with AI, focusing on key issues such as bias, decision-making, privacy, and the future of work.
The Problem of Bias in AI Systems
One of the most pressing ethical concerns in AI is the issue of bias. AI systems, particularly those based on machine learning, are trained on large datasets, which often include data from historical records or human behavior.

Essay 2: The Big Bang Theory (Science Topic)
The Big Bang Theory is the most widely accepted scientific explanation for the origin and evolution of the universe. It proposes that the universe began as a singularity—a point of infinite density and temperature—approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. The theory is based on a wealth of evidence from a variety of scientific disciplines, including astronomy, physics, and cosmology, and it has dramatically reshaped our understanding of the cosmos.
