Here's a test you might enjoy: rate these scenarios on a number scale, ranging from 1 for mild
discomfort to 7 for outrageous distress.
Scenario 1: you're flicking through news websites, as you do every morning. Today, however, you're
behind schedule and have only 15 minutes to read articles, instead of your usual 30. You have to
skip some of your favourite columns and sections. How would you rate your level of discomfort?
(Most of us would probably choose a low level, say 2.)
Scenario 2: you're visiting New York City and realise there's no way you'll be able to get to all the
exhibits, see all the recommended plays, or take in even a fraction of the 'musts' your local friends
have raved about. How do you feel now? Something like 5?
Scenario 3: you're at dinner with friends, and you've all agreed to make it a strictly phone-free
evening. But your smartphone won't stop beeping Twitter and text alerts. Something is obviously up
in your social network, but you can't check. Even 7 wouldn't match the stress you're feeling now.

our peace of mind.
