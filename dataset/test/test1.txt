Essay 1: The Problem of Free Will (Philosophical Topic)
The question of free will has been a subject of philosophical inquiry for centuries. It concerns the
extent to which human beings have the ability to make choices independent of external or internal
influences. This question touches on numerous aspects of human life, including morality,
responsibility, and identity. At its core, the problem of free will seeks to understand whether humans
are truly free in their decisions or whether their actions are determined by factors beyond their
control. In this essay, I will examine the concept of free will, the various perspectives on its
existence, and the implications of these perspectives on human life.
