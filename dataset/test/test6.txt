Climate Change and its Scientific Basis (Science Topic)
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. The scientific
consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and
industrial processes, are driving significant changes to the Earth's climate. These changes have
wide-ranging impacts, from rising global temperatures and extreme weather events to rising sea
levels and disruptions to ecosystems.
