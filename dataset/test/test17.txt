Animal magnetism
I like zoos. Really I do. I applaud today's zoological parks for their increasing emphasis on naturalistic exhibits, their breeding programmes for endangered species, and their efforts to educate the public about wildlife conservation. But the truth is, I mainly like zoos for the same reason that other people do: because I love watching animals.
Animals in captivity might satisfy our desire to cross the existential barrier that separates us from other creatures. Yet the sad reality is that, for the most part, zoo animals have become, as the art critic John Berger put it in 1977, 'a living monument to their own disappearance'.

Existentialism and the Meaning of Life (Philosophical Topic)
Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the 20th century, focusing on individual freedom, choice, and the inherent meaninglessness of life. Existentialists argue that life, by its very nature, does not provide an inherent meaning or purpose. Rather, it is up to each individual to create their own meaning through their choices, actions, and personal experiences. This perspective can be both liberating and terrifying, as it places the responsibility for finding meaning squarely on the shoulders of each individual.
The Roots of Existentialism
Although existentialism gained prominence in the 20th century, its roots can be traced back to earlier thinkers like SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche.
