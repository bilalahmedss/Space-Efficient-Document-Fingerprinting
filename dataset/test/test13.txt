Essay 2: Quantum Mechanics and the Uncertainty Principle (Science Topic)
Quantum mechanics is one of the most fascinating and revolutionary areas of modern physics. It
provides the framework for understanding the behavior of particles at the microscopic level, such as
atoms and subatomic particles. Unlike classical physics, which describes the motion of objects on a
large scale, quantum mechanics deals with phenomena that occur at scales where the effects of
quantum phenomena are significant.
