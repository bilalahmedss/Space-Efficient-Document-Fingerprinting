Animal magnetism
I like zoos. Really I do. I applaud today's zoological parks for their increasing emphasis on
naturalistic exhibits, their breeding programmes for endangered species, and their efforts to educate
the public about wildlife conservation. But the truth is, I mainly like zoos for the same reason that
other people do: because I love watching animals.
