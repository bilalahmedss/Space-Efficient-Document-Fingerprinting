Existentialism and the Meaning of Life (Philosophical Topic)
Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the 20th century, focusing on individual
freedom, choice, and the inherent meaninglessness of life. Existentialists argue that life, by its very
nature, does not provide an inherent meaning or purpose. Rather, it is up to each individual to
create their own meaning through their choices, actions, and personal experiences. This perspective
can be both liberating and terrifying, as it places the responsibility for finding meaning squarely on
the shoulders of each individual.
