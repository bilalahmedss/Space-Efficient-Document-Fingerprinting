Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) refers to the ethical obligations that businesses have towards society, the environment, and stakeholders beyond their shareholders.

Companies are no longer seen as purely profit-driven entities but as active participants in addressing the challenges facing the world today. By balancing profit and ethics, businesses can create value not only for their shareholders but also for their employees, customers, and the broader community.
