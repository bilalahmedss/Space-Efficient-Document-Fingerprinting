# Space-Efficient-Document-Fingerprinting
This repository contains the implementation of a space-efficient document fingerprinting system designed for scalable document similarity detection. The project utilizes Rabin-Karp hashing, MinHash algorithms, and Counting Bloom Filters to efficiently generate and index document fingerprints. The system is optimized for applications such as plagiarism detection, duplicate content identification, and search engine indexing. Key focus areas include memory optimization, computational efficiency, and accurate similarity detection across large text datasets.
