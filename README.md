# Space-Efficient-Document-Fingerprinting
This repository contains the implementation of a space-efficient document fingerprinting system designed for scalable document similarity detection. The project utilizes Rabin-Karp hashing, MinHash algorithms, and Counting Bloom Filters to efficiently generate and index document fingerprints.
